How does it work?

And here's how: three rules are created in iptables on the router

Let our router have two addresses: 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1
Socks5 server has address 192.168.2.4
Then the rules for clients will be:

iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -p udp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num xx
iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.2.4 -d 192.168.2.1 -p udp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num xx
iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -d 192.168.2.4 -p udp -j NFQUEUE --queue-num xx

As a result, all udp packets from the specified hosts that match the address mask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx will be forwarded through the SOCKS5 server to the destination address.

Naturally, the raw table must be activated in the kernel settings ... For some reason, it does not work in other tables.

The soxifier is launched with the following command:

udps-static -q xx. If it is necessary to run in daemon mode, but the -D option is added.

The udps.conf file is located in the /opt/udps/ directory


requires:
kernel >= 2.6.14
iptables >= 1.3.4
libnetfilter_queue >= 0.0.10
libconfig >= ?
